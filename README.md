!['RFM segments'](img/puzzle.jpg "RFM segments")



Identifying customer segments is beneficial for selecting profitable customers and developing customer loyalty. **RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis** is a simple technique for behaviour based customer segmentation. It is used to determine quantitatively which customers are the most valuable ones by examining:
* how recently a customer has purchased (recency),
* how often they purchase (frequency),
* how much the customer spends (monetary).
